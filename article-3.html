                        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>I'm sitting here at day 95 of my 100 days of code challenge. You might be wondering why I'm writing about 100 days of code and selling you short 5 days. Frankly, I've learned what I needed already in order to write this article for you so don't worry! Haha. Besides, I'm pretty much coding every day from this point onwards which is what both of us should do. You can go ahead and take that message home and just skip reading this article altogether. The important thing is I want you to code daily and if you get anything from my article, that's my only wish. There, now do you still feel like you got short-changed? I just gave you the biggest nugget. Okay, still interested? Let's continue...</p>
                        <p>The "<a href="http://100daysofcode.com/index.html">#100DaysOfCode</a>" challenge was created by Alexander Kallaway. The criteria are simple: code 1 hour every day and tweet your progress using the hashtag. There's another aspect, which I just discovered when I was researched this article, to fork the repository and keep your own journal. I have not done this obviously but it was still a good experience without it nonetheless. One of the criteria I didn't follow was "that time spent doing tutorials and online courses does not count towards the hour". A part of me was dependent on online courses to learn complex new ideas. I get that the challenge wants you to use that knowledge from online courses and spend an additional hour to build projects, but frankly, anything related to coding is good for you right? I didn't want to worry too much about it. You can find more information about this amazing concept at the <a href="http://100daysofcode.com/index.html">website</a> or the <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4">original article</a> that started this idea.</p>
                        <p>Let me tell you why I coincided El Penol de Guatape with my coding journey. I had the grand opportunity of living in Colombia, South America for months during my work hiatus. Yes, I was a bum but I was a bum learning to code though! In Colombia, there are many beautiful, exotic places to visit like Parque Tayrona, Comuna Trece, Palomino, Cerro El Volador, Cerro Quitasol, Parapente Medellin, and much, much more. If you ever want to go to Colombia for its evergreen spring weather, cheap cost of living, and beautiful places to see, just hit me up. I've lived there for nearly half a year so I would know a thing or two.</p>
                        <figure><img src="assets/article-2-img/penol-total-1024x768.png" alt="El Penol de Guatape" style="width: 60%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/><figcaption style=" text-align: center;">El Penol de Guatape.</figcaption></figure>
                        <p>Anyways, El Penol de Guatape was one of these wonderful places I visited and it is a monster-size rock to freaking climb. Count 740 steps to the summit of the rock and catch yellow painted numbers along the way to remind of your grueling ascent. I can attest that 100 days of code wasn't as physically challenging but it was almost as mentally challenge over a longer period of time. That depends however on how you defined your challenges every day though. Mines was to simply code for a minimum of 1 hour daily. Trust me, those daily errands are guaranteed to tug and pull at you along the way. How did I keep myself in-gear and speeding along? Read onwards, my coding friend.</p>
                        
                        <h2 id="keepingalogiseasypeazy">Keeping a log is easy-peazy</h2>
                        <p>One thing I did during my journey was to write 2 or 3 sentences daily about my coding progress. It started out on a slack channel when I was a part of a <a href="https://chingu-cohorts.github.io/chingu-directory/">Chingu</a> team. This team was going to be my enforcer to code every day but the problem was that I joined the team half-way through and didn't roll on a project. However, they had a daily-log section in the slack channel and I steadily plugged away my daily progress even though I wasn't actually coding with anyone on there. I didn't even start tweeting about coding every day until much later. Actually, I started tweeting right before I returned to Colombia from Japan since my friends went home and there were no more distractions. I started, slowly but surely, with bite-size bits of coding each day to start gaining momentum.</p>
                        <figure><img src="assets/article-2-img/robot-show-1024x768.png" alt="Robot Restaurant Show" style="width: 60%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/><figcaption style=" text-align: center;">Now do you understand why I couldn't start this challenge in Japan? ;)</figcaption></figure>
                        <p>I started with coding for 15 minutes every day and tweeting my progress. Don't feel that 15 minutes is small because we are building momentum in the beginning. A little every day goes a long way, bud, so keep going! Notice on my first day I started with 15 minutes but ended up doing an hour! Throughout the days following, I noticed I started getting reactions from members in the slack channel and that motivated me even more to keep logging every day and coding. Sometimes, people would interject to ask about my projects and the tools I used so that kept me on point too.</p>
                        <p>Keeping a log doesn't have to be difficult, I started out on a slack channel. Later, I migrated to Twitter as I noticed I got more support from strangers on the internet. It might sound strange to be motivated by random people but it felt good to see that little red heart on your tweets. Perhaps, someone cares enough about you to push a button too? Haha. Anyways, it felt good and I kept going. Pretty soon, I posted every day even when I didn't have much to report. Traveling with layovers and red-eye flights that wears you out? I got you. In a new exciting country that you want to explore like Japan or Colombia? I get you. So I would just try my best to generate ideas for my projects and review what I learned. Don't let the situation define your learning. Except for a lack of WiFi connection, that will ruin your life (I'm kidding). Just carry a JavaScript book or code offline. How do you think developers work and travel so well? You best be starting this skill if you're becoming a travel developer. Wink Wink.</p>
                        
                        <h2 id="thingsididduringmy100days">Things I did during my 100 days</h2>
                        <p>Let's get to the meat of the article, what did I actually do during my 100 days of code? I'm going to break it up here for notable moments of each 25-days. I even had to take a break from my vlogging at the time also to focus on coding, not that I miss it too much since I vlogged for 90 days straight. I know I'm a little bit of a focus-nut but maybe that's why I'm good at 100 days of code, wouldn't you say? With bags unpacked from Japan, I was determined to go harder on the challenge now.</p>

                        <h3 id="days1through25letsstartclimbingelpenol">Days 1 through 25: Let's start climbing El Penol!</h3>
                        <p>I was working on the "Basic Algorithm Scripting" and "JSON APIs and Ajax" section of the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Free Code Camp</a> curriculum. On about day 12, I started working on the "Intermediate Front End Development Projects". At about day 15, I built a quote machine app with hard-coded quotes but then also made an API version of the app. Then, I started building the weather app with Dark Sky API support after that and finished around day 22. The weather app was pretty difficult since you have to adapt many APIs to Codepen which gave me a lot of grief at the time. Then on day 23, I signed up for "<a href="https://flexbox.io/">What the Flexbox</a>" course with Wes Bos. </p>
                        <figure><img src="assets/article-2-img/25th-tweet-1024x576.png" alt="25th Tweet of #100DaysOfCode" style="width: 60%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/><figcaption style=" text-align: center;">My 25th tweet with #100DaysOfCode.</figcaption></figure>
                        
                        <h3 id="days26through50wemadeitaquarterway">Days 26 through 50: We made it a quarter way!</h3>
                        <p>I continued with the Flexbox course and finished about day 27. During this time, I was also applying for <a href="https://medium.com/chingu/voyage-build-2-learn-roadmap-ba4e25dda59e">Chingu-Voyage</a>'s Build-To-Learn cohort. I was excited since I would be able to collaborate with people now and not coding alone! Also on day 27, I decided to reinforce my Flexbox learning and signed up for "Flexbox Zombies" with David Geddes. I remembered I played that game for like 4 hours or more a day and finished "<a href="http://flexboxzombies.com/p/flexbox-zombies">Flexbox Zombies</a>" around day 30. Around day 31, I started to prepare for my Chingu-Voyage Team. Uneventfully, there were some troubles with my team lead so the project never took off but I continued on with learning CSS grids through <a href="https://gridbyexample.com/">Rachel Andrew's website</a> on day 33. I watched a lot of talks and played around with the technology. However, version control crept its ugly head again so I decided to handle it and started Udacity's "Git and Github" on day 39 and finished on day 43. That's when I found a superior, modern Git course called "<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123">Version Control with Git</a>" with Richard Kalehoff on day 45 and finished day 49. Read more about this experience in the article <a href="http://timothyhoang.net/article-1.html">Learning Git and Github - Now Hating That I Love It</a> that I wrote.</p>

                        <h3 id="days51through75halfwayarewethereyet">Days 51 through 75: Half-way, are we there yet!?</h3>
                        <p>My Chingu-Voyage team project still didn't take off. Sad face. So on day 51, I started the continuation of the course with Richard with "<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/github-collaboration--ud456">Github and Collaboration</a>" and finished on day 60. Now I felt like a Git/Github pro which will soon be put to the test when I joined another Chingu-Voyage team on day 57 to clone the popular Chrome Extension Momentum Dash. On day 60, I also decided to strip my portfolio site that I built in November 2016 to apply Flexbox, new knowledge, and version control. Through my time with the new Chingu-Voyage team, I did some animations &amp; transitions for picture credits, implemented a google search function in the app, and applied more transitions to the to-do list and settings options. On day 63, I started the "JavaScript: The Tricky Stuff" as part of the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Colt Steele course on Udemy</a>. During this time, I also fell in love with Visual Studio Code, switched over to it, learned to implement the bash terminal inside, and also cleaned up a significant part of my Github profile.</p>

                        <p>I started "<a href="https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript">Practical JavaScript</a>" with Gordon Zhu and continued on with my portfolio website. Day 78 was the day we finished <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/turtle-dash/odijnkiclhddnfdgnbjghchkhagnooek">our team app for Chingu-Voyage</a> because that's when I wrote a Chrome Web Store description for my team. I finally finished Practical JavaScript on day 89. I also re-coded my quote machine app without Codepen on day 79. I decided that Codepen was too clunky and I wanted more practice with using Github to host my projects. Then, I went to an "Intro to React" workshop on day 87, which didn't turn out to be all that great but got me inspired to learn more. I also published my first blog article entitled "<a href="http://timothyhoang.net/article-1.html">Learning Git and Github - Now Hating That I Love It</a>" on day 89 which wasn't too difficult to write but I really got a kick out of revisiting my writing skills. After I finished my quote machine app, I started re-coding my weather app without Codepen on day 91 and still working on it today (day 95). Now I'm back in the states so I wanted to collaborate with my developer friend to host events for our local Free Code Camp group on day 91. I went to a CSS grids layout event with speaker Jesse Eldredge on day 93. That weekend, we had our first FCC meetup on day 94 which was really productive! That finally brings us to today, day 95.

                        <h2 id="whyandhowyoushouldlogdaily">Why and how you should log daily</h2>
                        <p>So am I saying you should code for 100 days and log it just so you can write an article like me? I certainly hope not. You should write an article if you want to. The reason you should log is that it is an amazing habit builder. When I was in pharmacy school and doing various self-improvement projects, I was taught that if you can do something for 30 days, or even better 90 days, you build an indestructible habit. It makes you feel guilty for skipping out on your task. For an organized strong-type like me, I rely on structure, predictability, and repeatability to learn. Yup, I'm just a big dumb ape on this rock that needs a couple hits to the head to get things through! Haha.</p>
                        <p>You also make good friends along the way since they give you a like, comment, or help you with your journey if you share it publicly. Decide to start with a small notebook, twitter, facebook, or a slack channel like I did! When you finish you have something to look back on after the journey which has nice "yearbook" feels, catch my drift? We, humans, are also a very forgetful creature so recounting the things we did yesterday will help us get us focused for today. Since you're human, let me remind you on how you get started.</p>
                        <p>Level one is to start logging your journey every day with 1 or 2 sentences about whatever you're doing whether it's 100 days of code, 100 pounds to lose, or 100 books to read. This will reinforce that guilt factor into you so that you don't start popping on Netflix. Even if you do only 5, 10, or 15 minutes worth, that's better than nothing at all. Also, through my years of learning, when you start something it is mighty difficult to get the ball rolling. However, once you got something started, it's really hard to want to stop. At least that's how it feels for me anyways and I hope it's the same for you. Ever notice how hard it is to push a car at rest but once you get it rolling, it takes less effort? It's kind of like that.</p>
                        <p>Level two is to start logging your journey publicly for all the world and your mother to see. You would not want to certainly disappoint your mother right? This adds another level of accountability beyond the guilt factor. That factor would be pride. This cardinal sin of 7 will hopefully make you want to save face by not being humiliated in front of others (although it won't ever get that far). If you're more of the competitive type, you might want to be ahead or beat your friends in the race. That's a good motivator too. There might be a million reasons to start sharing your public journey but have your pick and just do it Nike-style!</p>
                        
                        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
                        <figure><img src="assets/article-2-img/bane-permission-1024x681.png" alt="Bane's Permission Quote" style="width: 60%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/><figcaption style=" text-align: center;">I want to die.</figcaption></figure>
                        <p>I'm finally glad that 100 days of code are over but I'm going to continue with this momentum that I've built with it! My next plan? Hit 30 days of JavaScript with Wes Bos and doing Free Code Camp until I finish the front end certification. Although I won't tweet with #100daysofcode, you and I know that I will still be tweeting every day about my progress. I'm looking for another tag like that but only found #codedaily, #codeeveryday, or #code247. I'm sure I'll find some tag to add of course. The more important things will be the projects I'm working on of course. I'm hoping in the next 100 days, I will be applying to jobs and landing my first junior developer position also! I'm super excited about that!</p>
                        <p>As you can see, 100 days of code is a lot like El Penol de Guatape. There are many steps and days in your journey ahead but you must push onwards. As things get rough, remember that it makes you stronger and gets you one step closer to your goal. If you can climb with your friends and talk about the journey, it makes it go by even faster. Before you know it, you will have reached the top of the 740 steps and blessed with a breathtaking view of the landscape. I hope that you get to see Colombia in your lifetime as I did as there are much more beautiful things than a couple pictures can ever do proper justice with. Let me know if you're going!</p>
                        <figure><img src="assets/article-2-img/top-view-1024x768.png" alt="The View At The Top" style="width: 60%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/><figcaption style=" text-align: center;">It was all worth it in the end.</figcaption></figure>
                        <p>What's the takeaway from this article? Don't stop coding and log about your coding daily. It builds strong habits, helps make friends, and develops your coding skills! Don't let something as silly as 100 days of code challenge make you stop there. Why shoot for the top of the ladder when you can shoot for the stars? I hope this article has motivated or inspired you to take action about logging your coding progress. If you picked up something like that, I feel like I've done some good here today. This is travelDev signing off and wishing you a great journey. Adios amigos!</p>

            <p>Often, I find myself falling on and off the path of web development. I will have short bursts of inspiration to code certain weeks and then fall behind the next. This past week, I was working on the Wikipedia Viewer App from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Free Code Camp</a> curriculum however I was not getting the data from my API request to render onto the page. I got frustrated and decided to step back for a bit and focus on other topics. So I ended up reading <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20&amp;%20going/README.md#you-dont-know-js-up--going">You Don't Know JS - Book 1</a> by Kyle Simpson and taking <a href="https://es6.io/">ES6 for Everyone</a> by Wes Bos. Going back to the learning process gave me a sense of control again away from the building process. I'm sure other aspiring developers can identify with this "hop-a-round-itis" and jumping around multiple topics. A lot of advice for newbie developers is to stick through the process and you will become better for it. That's certainly true but it is okay to take a break sometimes too to recollect yourself in the process. One other thing I have in my hands is controlling what I'm listening to (or not in some cases) when I'm coding. Take a step back and pick the courses you want to do, the songs you want to listen to, and where to focus your time. You have my permission to because coding is infinitely more fun if it is interesting.</p>
            <figure><img src="assets/article-3-img/wikipedia-app-1024x576.png" alt="My Unfinished Wikipedia App" style="width: 60%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/><figcaption style=" text-align: center;">Sometimes, I get frustrated too.</figcaption></figure>
            <p>This article will be a mix of self-motivation, choosing the right path, and developing habits that will help you continue along that path. The first thing is to simply put your headphones (or earbuds) on and center yourself to your inner coding world. When I turn on some scores or uptempo music, I fade into a certain bliss and it becomes much easier to focus on coding. The mere act of putting your headphones on over and over again forces a habit. You're mind knows that you want it to go into "code mode" and it's a muscle that gets stronger the more you work it out. Except we're not doing any heavy weights here so relax. Choosing the songs to listen to is very similar to choosing the right courses: pick what you enjoy and works for you. The only recommendation is to have music with no lyrics. Nothing is worse than sticking with a course that you don't mesh well with especially with the teaching style, outdated examples, or lack of enjoyment. Then, the commitment becomes sticking to the process of coding everyday and not so much about sticking with the same course if you don't enjoy it. Last, don't forget to share your resources with others. If you enjoy a song or a course, tell others about it. I'm sure they would benefit from it too!</p>
            
            <h2 id="pickingyourcourses">Picking Your Courses</h2>
            <p>So start by putting on those headphones with some music you enjoy. For me, I especially enjoy coding to "The Island" soundtrack. I made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=244AT-9e-cU&amp;list=PLPTS2VjPOpjUBnIFFUphcKqzdBLTWPfqQ">30-min playlist</a> which you can listen to when you work. I define the music as complex but inspiring with the last track making you feel like you made a triumphant return home (or made progress bashing away at the keyboard after 30 minutes, your pick)! When I turn this on to an optimal volume to block out the outside world, that's when I really zone in and try to bang it out for 30 minutes without any distractions. Knowing that after 30 minutes I can release myself, it makes it easier to get started. This is somewhat synonymous with the Pomodoro Technique for those who have not heard of it. Except here we are using music to time instead of using a clock, which give me a teensy bit of temporal anxiety. Remember those days when you were taking a timed test in high school or college? Yes, so I don't like to watch clocks too much while I work for this reason.</p>
            <figure><img src="assets/article-3-img/code30-playlist-1024x576.png" alt="My Coding Playlist" style="width: 60%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/><figcaption style=" text-align: center;">I enjoy coding to my playlist.</figcaption></figure>
            <p>The same idea goes for choosing a course or path of web development. I'm sure you were lost in the mire of what path to learn the quickest. Choose what seems interesting to you and start doing it. The problem is now there are many resources online to learn development so choosing between them is a challenge in itself. It would be best to get started with something broad like <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>, which exposes you to html, css, javascript, python, ruby, etc. Try things out and don't get too invested into one specific language yet. Then you can move on to <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Free Code Camp</a> to get deeper into front-end development. Further along your path, you end up deeper into the language and you find resource like <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a>, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>, <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">Team Treehouse</a>, <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/">Front End Masters</a>, and the list goes on. The question is where is the best place to learn? Check to see if they have a free trial, check the reviews, and see what feels right for you. To be honest, there might be some courses from each website that are great and some that are not. Take Udemy for example, your course quality might vary but it's generally not bad to go with the bestsellers and ones that have good ratings with a lot of students. The goal here is to find something that you will keep coming back to and not necessarily the best course. It might not be the best course for you.</p>
            
            <h2 id="sharingwithothers">Sharing with Others</h2>
            <p>So now you have your playlist and courses already picked out and you're already hitting the ground running? That sounds great and you should pat yourself on the back. The challenge is now to do a little bit everyday and making a strong habit. This is where the real people do work. Try in earnest to finish a course you enjoy. The best way to learn is by applying your knowledge to a project also. What really helps me is to find people who are also aspiring developers and talk to them about resources you have; be it good music or courses that you have taken. This helps sparks conversation and talk about issues on the topic. For example, when I was learning about asynchronous javascript request, I loved sharing with my friends about what I was learning and seeing what their experience were. Another time, they asked me if I enjoyed the Practical JavaScript course I took online.</p>
            <figure><img src="assets/article-3-img/codeshare-site-1024x576.png" alt="Codeshare Website" style="width: 60%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/><figcaption style=" text-align: center;">We used codeshare.io but glitch works too!</figcaption></figure>
            <p>Your friends might also want to be taking the same course with you. This is another way to get through the challeneges together and make it more fun. I remember when I was code-sharing with my friend on <a href="https://codeshare.io/">codeshare.io</a>. We were both working on the same algorithm challenge and using our collective knowledge to work through the problem together. It all started out because we were sharing about the challenges in the courses we were undertaking. Start some conversations with with others and this will help open up communications for learning together, keeping you motivated, and helps you feel like you're fighting on the same side. It's like having a gym buddy to help spot you on that bench press. You might not need them but it's comforting to know that they can lend a hand when you're struggling. They also might need your extraordinary web development skills in the future too, amirite?</p>
            
            <h2 id="maintainingyourcoursepath">Maintaining Your Course Path</h2>
            <p>The further you wander down the rabbit hole, the more topics you will see in web development. If it was overwhelming in the beginning, now it seems that it's even worse. Don't worry! Just keep a log of what courses you did in a google document. You are doing that aren't you? This will help build a roadmap for you and help point you the way you need to go. Working with the weather app from Free Code Camp Curriculum, I realized I had no experience with APIs and rendering data to HTML from JavaScript. So I referred back to my course path and saw that I had some resources lined up that might possibly help me in working through it. So you see that I'm not only keeping track of courses I have taken but also project the ones I want to take in the future. You and I both know that you have a stash of Udemy courses you bought and saved up for Web Development. Isn't it about time that you brought some life into them?</p>
            <figure><img src="assets/article-3-img/udemy-courses-1024x576.png" alt="Udemy Courses" style="width: 60%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/><figcaption style=" text-align: center;">I know you got a bunch of these too.</figcaption></figure>
            <p>From time to time, my music taste changes also. I made a couple playlists since "The Island" soundtrack and still come back to listen to it from time to time. I'm telling you it's okay to change paths because you simply can't see past the beginner's fog until you get closer and closer to where you need to go. That fork in the road? You couldn't see it 100 yards out but it is much easier to spot 15 yards away. So keep track of what you're learning and where you want to go. It will be easier to start driving in a new general direction once you've reach your first destination to start thinking about the next. Mark the old item on your list as complete to get them feel goods and then start heading towards the next course on your list.</p>
            <figure><img src="assets/article-3-img/my-path-1024x576.png" alt="My Coding Path" style="width: 60%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/><figcaption style=" text-align: center;">That google doc I was talking about.</figcaption></figure>
        </div>

        <div id="article-conclusion">
            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Start with the things you have control over like putting on some headphones and music. Tell yourself you only have to code for 10 minutes. Once you get to 10 minutes, ask yourself if you can do 10 more minutes. Chances are you will say yes. You're already deep in the AJAX call, the momentum in your mind will actually urge you to continue. Trust me on this one. Time and time again, this has happened to me when I lost track of that initial 10 minutes and then never even bothered to ask myself to do 10 more. I just keep on going!</p>
            <figure><img src="assets/article-3-img/my-headphones-1024x576.png" alt="My Coding Headphones" style="width: 60%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/><figcaption style=" text-align: center;">How I start making magic.</figcaption></figure>
            <p>Over time, the same music might get over-played so it's time to switch it up. Don't ever feel that you have to stick to one topic forever. Experiment a little bit and find new things that you like and keep going. Find new music and courses that you like. Along the way, map out where you are in your web development journey and take notes of the things you want to try in the future. The important thing today is that you put on those headphones and pop that music. Cheers to your success, my friend.</p>
